# Lab 1 - Install Marathon-LB, Prometheus, and Grafana

Note: These lab exercises assume you have a working DC/OS cluster and have successfully attached the DC/OS CLI to that cluster. 


## Step 1 - Install Marathon-LB 

_If you are undertaking these lab exercises as part of a broader DC/OS days workshop, you may already have Marathon-LB installed on a public node in your cluster. If you already have Marathon-LB installed, please skip this step._

Marathon-LB is an easy-to-use, HAProxy-based load balancer most commonly used to expose services running on DC/OS to the public Internet.

To install Marathon-LB on DC/OS, first navigate to the *Catalog* tab in your DC/OS UI.

In the search box, search for `marathon-lb` and select *marathon-lb*.
